In the big cities of the Republic, despite the endless efforts of consecrated men, it is laid up with a wasting disease. The very Sunday-school superintendents, taking jazz from the stealthy radio, shake their fire-proof legs; their pupils, moving into adolescence, no longer respond to the proliferating hormones by enlisting for missionary service in Africa, but resort to necking instead. Even in Dayton, I found, though the mob was up to do execution on Scopes, there was a strong smell of antinomianism. The nine churches of the village were all half empty on Sunday, and weeds choked their yards. Only two or three of the resident pastors managed to sustain themselves by their ghostly science; the rest had to take orders for mail-order pantaloons or work in the adjacent strawberry fields; one, I heard, was a barber.... Exactly twelve minutes after I reached the village I was taken in tow by a Christian man and introduced to the favorite tipple of the Cumberland Range; half corn liquor and half Coca-Cola. It seemed a dreadful dose to me, but I found that the Dayton illuminati got it down with gusto, rubbing their tummies and rolling their eyes. They were all hot for Genesis, but their faces were too florid to belong to teetotalers, and when a pretty girl came tripping down the main street, they reached for the places where their neckties should have been with all the amorous enterprise of movie stars....</span></p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000198\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000198\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><div class=\\\"quote\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000199\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000199\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>This is pure Mencken in its surging momentum and its irreverence.

It’s a quilt of instant words patched together out of other parts of speech. Adjectives are used as nouns (“greats,” “notables”). Nouns are used as verbs (“to host”), or they are chopped off to form verbs (“enthuse,” “emote”), or they are padded to form verbs (“beef up,” “put teeth into”). This is a world where eminent people are “famed” and their associates are “staffers,” where the future is always “upcoming” and someone is forever “firing off” a note. Nobody in America has sent a note or a memo or a telegram in years. Famed diplomat Condoleezza Rice, who hosts foreign notables to beef up the morale of top State Department staffers, sits down and fires off a lot of notes.

They push the sentence forward and give it momentum. Active verbs push hard; passive verbs tug fitfully. Active verbs also enable us to visualize an activity because they require a pronoun (“he”), or a noun (“the boy”), or a person (“Mrs. Scott”) to put them in motion. Many verbs also carry in their imagery or in their sound a suggestion of what they mean: glitter, dazzle, twirl, beguile, scatter, swagger, poke, pamper, vex. Probably no other language has such a vast supply of verbs so bright with color. Don’t choose one that is dull or merely serviceable. Make active verbs activate your sentences, and avoid the kind that need an appended preposition to complete their work. Don’t set up a business that you can start or launch.

The quickest way out is to break the long sentence into two short sentences, or even three. There is no minimum length for a sentence that’s acceptable in the eyes of God. Among good writers it is the short sentence that predominates, and don’t tell me about Norman Mailer—he’s a genius. If you want to write long sentences, be a genius.

Instead, construct your sentence so that the order of the words will put the emphasis where you want it. Also resist using an exclamation point to notify the reader that you are making a joke or being ironic. “It never occurred to me that the water pistol might be loaded!” Readers are annoyed by your reminder that this was a comical moment.

Therefore it should be used sparingly by modern writers of nonfiction. Yet I notice that it turns up quite often in the passages I’ve quoted in this book and that I use it often myself—usually to add a related thought to the first half of a sentence. Still, the semicolon brings the reader, if not to a halt, at least to a pause.

One is to amplify or justify in the second part of the sentence a thought you stated in the first part. “We decided to keep going—it was only 100 miles more and we could get there in time for dinner.” By its very shape the dash pushes the sentence ahead and explains why they decided to keep going. The other use involves two dashes, which set apart a parenthetical thought within a longer sentence. “She told me to get in the car—she had been after me all summer to have a haircut—and we drove silently into town.” An explanatory detail that might otherwise have required a separate sentence is neatly dispatched along the way.</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000439\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000439\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext1\\\"><span><b class=\\\"calibre7\\\"><i class=\\\"calibre9\\\">The Colon</i>.</b> The colon has begun to look even more antique than the semicolon, and many of its functions have been taken over by the dash.

Nor was it how families lived in other parts of the world. Even in the poorest villages of Spain and Italy, he recalled, people would drop in with a loaf of bread.

The time when his friends deserted him was the time when he needed them most. By getting sick he almost seemed to have done something shameful.

It combined my lifelong vocation with my lifelong addiction—which is one of the best things that can happen to a writer; people will write better and with more enjoyment if they write about what they care about. I chose spring training as my small corner of the large subject of baseball because it’s a time of renewal, both for the players and for the fans. The game is given back to us in its original purity: it’s played outside, in the sun, on grass, without organ music, by young men who are almost near enough to touch and whose salaries and grievances are mercifully put aside for six weeks. Above all, it’s a time of teaching and learning. I chose the Pittsburgh Pirates as the team I would cover because they trained in an old-time ballpark in Bradenton, Florida, and were a young club just starting to rebuild, with a manager, Jim Leyland, who was committed to teaching.</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000559\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000559\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>I didn’t want to romanticize the game.

Historically, in America, good journalism becomes good literature. H. L.

If nonfiction is where you do your best writing, or your best teaching of writing, don’t be buffaloed into the idea that it’s an inferior species.

The seemingly simple use of a tape recorder isn’t simple; infinite stitchery is required.</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000633\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000633\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>But my main reasons for warning you off it are practical. One hazard is that you don’t usually have a tape recorder with you; you are more likely to have a pencil. Another is that tape recorders malfunction. Few moments in journalism are as glum as the return of a reporter with “a really great story,” followed by his pushing of the PLAY button and silence. But above all, a writer should be able to see his materials. If your interview is on tape you become a listener, forever fussing with the machine, running it backward to find the brilliant remark you can never quite find, running it forward, stopping, starting, driving yourself crazy.

I like the transaction with another person. I like the fact that that person can see me <i class=\\\"calibre9\\\">working</i>—doing a job, not just sitting there letting a machine do it for me. Only once did I use a tape recorder extensively: for my book, <i class=\\\"calibre9\\\">Mitchell &amp; Ruff</i>, about the jazz musicians Willie Ruff and Dwike Mitchell. Although I knew both men well, I felt that a white writer who presumes to write about the black experience has an obligation to get the tonalities right. It’s not that Ruff and Mitchell speak a different kind of English; they speak good and often eloquent English. But as Southern blacks they use certain words and idioms that are distinctive to their heritage, adding richness and humor to what they say. I didn’t want to miss any of those usages. My tape recorder caught them all, and readers of the book can hear that I got the two men right.

Masson. The other was the revelation by Joe McGinniss that in his biography of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, <i class=\\\"calibre9\\\">The Last Brother</i>, he had “written certain scenes and described certain events from what I have inferred to be his point of view,” though he never interviewed Kennedy himself. Such blurring of fact and fiction is a trend that bothers careful writers of nonfiction—an assault on the craft. Yet even for a conscientious reporter this is uncertain terrain. Let me invoke the work of Joseph Mitchell to suggest some guidelines. The seamless weaving of quotes through his prose was a hallmark of Mitchell’s achievement in the brilliant articles he wrote for <i class=\\\"calibre9\\\">The New Yorker</i> from 1938 to 1965, many of them dealing with people who worked around the New York waterfront.

They taste like asparagus. The old women in Sandy Ground used to believe in eating pokeweed shoots, the old Southern women. They said it renewed your blood. My mother believed it. Every spring she used to send me out in the woods to pick pokeweed shoots. And I believe it. So every spring, if I think about it, I go pick some and cook them. It’s not that I like them so much—in fact, they give me gas—but they remind me of the days gone by, they remind me of my mother. Now, away down here in the woods in this part of Staten Island, you might think you were fifteen miles on the other side of nowhere, but just a little ways up Arthur Kill Road, up near Arden Avenue, there’s a bend in the road where you can sometimes see the tops of the skyscrapers in New York. Just the tallest skyscrapers, and just the tops of them. It has to be an extremely clear day. Even then, you might be able to see them one moment and the next moment they’re gone. Right beside this bend in the road there’s a little swamp, and the edge of this swamp is the best place I know to pick pokeweed. I went up there one morning this spring to pick some, but we had a late spring, if you remember, and the pokeweed hadn’t come up. The fiddleheads were up, and golden club, and spring beauty, and skunk cabbage, and bluets, but no pokeweed. So I was looking here and looking there, and not noticing where I was stepping, and I made a misstep, and the next thing I knew I was up to my knees in mud. I floundered around in the mud a minute, getting my bearings, and then I happened to raise my head and look up, and suddenly I saw, away off in the distance, miles and miles away, the tops of the skyscrapers in New York shining in the morning sun.

He made a literary arrangement, pretending to have spent one afternoon being shown around the cemetery, whereas I would guess, knowing his famously patient and courteous manner and his lapidary methods, that the article took at least a year of strolling, chatting, writing and rewriting.

Nobody turns so quickly into a bore as a traveler home from his travels. He enjoyed his trip so much that he wants to tell us all about it—and “all” is what we don’t want to hear. We only want to hear some. What made his trip different from everybody else’s? What can he tell us that we don’t already know?

But that is ground already covered by multitudes of people. As a writer you must keep a tight rein on your subjective self—the traveler touched by new sights and sounds and smells—and keep an objective eye on the reader.

Half the sights seen in a day’s sightseeing are quaint, especially windmills and covered bridges; they are certified for quaintness. Towns situated in hills (or foothills) are nestled—I hardly ever read about an unnestled town in the hills—and the countryside is dotted with byways, preferably half forgotten. In Europe you awake to the clip-clop of horse-drawn wagons along a history-haunted river; you seem to hear the scratch of a quill pen. This is a world where old meets new—old never meets old.

Through the night, it could find its way into our ears; sometimes, even on the sleeping porch, midnight could wake us up. My parents’ bedroom had a smaller striking clock that answered it. Though the kitchen clock did nothing but show the time, the dining room clock was a cuckoo clock with weights on long chains, on one of which my baby brother, after climbing on a chair to the top of the china closet, once succeeded in suspending the cat for a moment. I don’t know whether or not my father’s Ohio family, in having been Swiss back in the 1700s before the first three Welty brothers came to America, had anything to do with this; but we all of us have been time-minded all our lives. This was good at least for a future fiction writer, being able to learn so penetratingly, and almost first of all, about chronology. It was one of a good many things I learned almost without knowing it; it would be there when I needed it.</span></p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000785\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000785\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><div class=\\\"quote\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000786\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000786\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><div class=\\\"quote\\\"><p class=\\\"extract\\\"><span>My father loved all instruments that would instruct and fascinate.

(How often we start writing a letter out of obligation and only discover in the third paragraph that we have something we really want to say to the person we’re writing to.) What Virginia Woolf intimately wrote during her lifetime has been immensely helpful to other women wrestling with similar angels and demons.

I was unhappy, and ashamed of it; I was baffled by my life. For several years in my early thirties, I would sit in my armchair reading books about these other lives. Sometimes when I came to the end, I would sit down and read the book through from the beginning again. I remember an incredible intensity about all this, and also a kind of furtiveness—as if I were afraid that someone might look through the window and find me out. Even now, I feel I should pretend that I was reading only these women’s fiction or their poetry—their lives as they chose to present them, alchemized as art. But that would be a lie. It was the private messages I really liked—the journals and letters, and autobiographies and biographies whenever they seemed to be telling the truth. I felt very lonely then, self absorbed, shut off. I needed all this murmured chorus, this continuum of true-life stories, to pull me through. They were like mothers and sisters to me, these literary women, many of them already dead; more than my own family, they seemed to stretch out a hand. I had come to New York when I was young, as so many come, in order to invent myself. And, like many modern people—modern women, especially—I had catapulted out of my context.... The successes [of the writers] gave me hope, of course, yet it was the desperate bits I liked best. I was looking for directions, gathering clues. I was especially grateful for the secret, shameful things about these women—the pain: the abortions and misalliances, the pills they took, the amount they drank.

There’s no limit to how wide the pyramid can become, but your readers will understand the broad implications only if they start with one narrow fact.</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000854\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000854\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>A good example is an article by Harold M.

Most of us can’t hear these. At our youngest and keenest of ear, we might detect sounds of 20,000 vibrations a second, but bats can vocalize at up to 200,000. They do it not in a steady stream but at intervals—20 or 30 times a second. A bat listens for the sounds to return to it, and when the echoes start coming faster and louder it knows that the insect it’s stalking has flown nearer. By judging the time between echoes, a bat can tell how fast the prey is moving and in which direction. Some bats are sensitive enough to register a beetle walking on sand, and some can detect the movement of a moth flexing its wings as it sits on a leaf.</span></p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000913\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000913\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><div class=\\\"quote\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000914\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000914\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>That’s my idea of sensitive; I couldn’t ask a writer to give me two more wonderful examples.

Then, at just the right instant, neutrons are released, initiating the ultrafast fission chain reaction—an atomic blast. Thus the main elements of an implosion device are a firing system, an explosive assembly, and the core. The firing system includes vacuum-tube-based, high-energy discharge devices called krytons that are capable of releasing enough energy to detonate the conventional explosive. The explosive assembly includes “lenses” that precisely focus the spherical, imploding shock wave on the fissile core, within which is a neutronic initiator.

You don’t care how it works, but if it breaks you want someone there to fix it.” Notice how refreshing that sentence is after all the garbage that preceded it: in its language (comfortable words), in its details that we can visualize (the pencil), and in its humanity. The writer has taken the coldness out of a technical process by relating it to an experience we’re all familiar with: waiting for the repairman when something breaks. I’m reminded of a sign I saw in the New York subway that proves that even a huge municipal bureaucracy can talk to its constituents humanely: “If you ride the subway regularly you may have seen signs directing you to trains you’ve never heard of before.

But if baseball started with Little Caesar, it wound up with Ethelred the Unready.” Red Smith was the daily guardian of our perspective, a writer who kept us honest.

They look at thoughtful Chet Huntley and find him thoughtful, and at witty David Brinkley and find him witty. They look at Vietnam. They look at Vietnam, it seems, as a child kneeling in the corridor, his eye to the keyhole, looks at two grownups arguing in a locked room—the aperture of the keyhole small; the figures shadowy, mostly out of sight; the voices indistinct, isolated threats without meaning; isolated glimpses, part of an elbow, a man’s jacket (who is the man?), part of a face, a woman’s face. Ah, she is crying. One sees the tears. (The voices continue indistinctly.) One counts the tears. Two tears. Three tears. Two bombing raids. Four seek-and-destroy missions. Six administration pronouncements. Such a fine-looking woman. One searches in vain for the other grownup, but, ah, the keyhole is so small, he is somehow never in the line of sight. Look! There is General Ky. Look! There are some planes returning safely to the <i class=\\\"calibre9\\\">Ticonderoga</i>.

It disturbs us—as criticism often should—because it jogs a set of beliefs and forces us to reexamine them. What holds our attention is the metaphor of the keyhole, so exact and yet so mysterious. But what remains is a fundamental question about how the country’s most powerful medium told the people about the war they were fighting—and escalating. The column ran in 1966, when most Americans still supported the Vietnam war. Would they have turned against it sooner if TV had widened the keyhole, had shown us not only the “swirl of dress” but the severed head and the burning child? It’s too late now to know.

Many people regarded Sahl as a cynic, but he thought of himself as an idealist. “If I criticize somebody,” he said, “it’s because I have higher hopes for the world, something good to replace the bad.

Humor is not a separate organism that can survive on its own frail metabolism. It’s a special angle of vision granted to certain writers who already write good English. They aren’t writing about life that’s essentially ludicrous; they are writing about life that’s essentially serious, but their eye falls on areas where serious hopes are mocked by some ironic turn of fate—“the strange incongruity,” as Stephen Leacock put it, “between our aspiration and our achievement.” E. B. White made the same point. “I don’t like the word ‘humorist,’” he said. “It seems to me misleading. Humor is a by-product that occurs in the serious work of some and not others. I was more influenced by Don Marquis than by Ernest Hemingway, by Perelman than by Dreiser.”</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001243\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001243\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>Therefore I suggest several principles for the writer of humor. Master the craft of writing good “straight” English; humorists from Mark Twain to Russell Baker are, first of all, superb writers. Don’t search for the outlandish and scorn what seems too ordinary; you will touch more chords by finding what’s funny in what you know to be true. Finally, don’t strain for laughs; humor is built on surprise, and you can surprise the reader only so often.</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001244\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001244\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>Unfortunately for writers, humor is elusive and subjective. No two people think the same things are funny, and a piece that one magazine will reject as a dud is often published by another that finds it a jewel. The reasons for rejection are equally elusive. “It just doesn’t work,” editors say, and there’s not much they can add. Occasionally such a piece can be made to work—it has some flaw that can be repaired. Mortality, however, is high. “Humor can be dissected, as a frog can,” E. B.

First, find a nice station on the car radio, one that she likes. Get into the pleasant lull of freeway driving—tires humming along the pavement, air conditioner on max. Then turn to look at her across the front seat and say something like, “You know, you’ve really kept your shape, Mom, and don’t think I haven’t noticed.” Or suppose she comes into your room to bring you some clean socks. Take her by the wrist, pull her close, and say, “Mom, you’re the most fascinating woman I’ve ever met.” Probably she’ll tell you to cut out the foolishness, but I can guarantee you one thing: she will never tell your dad.

He was very conservative as to hemlines, however; when Saint Laurent lifted skirts to the knee in 1959, the President waited three months for Congress to decide the issue, and then, losing all patience, switched to Balenciaga with a stroke of his pen.

At first I told them to write in one of the existing humor forms—satire, parody, lampoon, etc.—and not to use “I” or to write from their own experience. I assigned the same topic to the whole class, bringing in some absurdity I had noticed in the newspaper. The students jumped boldly into free association, surrealism and nonsense. They found that it was possible to slip off the chains of logic and to have fun making a serious point within a given humor form.

I recalled him from my boyhood as hilarious but was afraid that, as often happens in looking up old friends, he would turn out to be merely “comical.” His pieces, however, had survived the erosion of time, and one that I particularly remembered—“My Financial Career,” in which he tries to open a bank account with $56—still seems the model piece of humor on how rattled we all become when dealing with banks, libraries and other uptight institutions. Rereading Leacock reminded me that another function of the humorist is to represent himself or herself as the victim or dunce, helpless in most situations. It’s therapy for readers, enabling them to feel superior to the writer, or at least to identify with a fellow victim. A humorist who deals with ordinary life never runs out of material, as Erma Bombeck enjoyably proved over many decades.</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001332\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001332\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>So that was the direction in which our Yale humor class began to move. Many of the students wrote about their families. We ran into problems, mainly of exaggeration, and gradually solved them, trying to achieve control, cutting the extra sentence that explains a funny point that is already implicit. A hard decision was to know how much exaggeration was allowable and how much was too much. One student wrote a funny piece about what a terrible cook his grandmother was. When I praised it he said she was really a very good cook. I said I was sorry to hear it—somehow the piece now seemed less funny. He asked if that made a difference. I said it didn’t make a difference in this piece, since I had enjoyed it without knowing it was untrue, but that I thought he would last longer if he started from the truth rather than from invention—surely one secret of James Thurber’s longevity as a major American humorist. In Thurber’s “The Night the Bed Fell” we know that he has slightly enlarged the facts.

This was a generation reared on television, where the picture is valued more than the word—where the word, in fact, is devalued, used as mere chatter and often misused and mispronounced. It was also a generation reared on music—songs and rhythms meant primarily to be heard and felt. With so much noise in the air, was any American child being trained to listen?

A writer with an ear for language will reach for fresh imagery and avoid phrases that are trite. The hack will reach for those very clichés, thinking he will enrich his thoughts with currency that is, as he would put it, tried and true. Another part of the answer lies in simplicity. Writing that will endure tends to consist of words that are short and strong; words that sedate are words of three, four and five syllables, mostly of Latin origin, many of them ending in “ion” and embodying a vague concept. In Wilbur Cross’s Thanksgiving Proclamation there are no four-syllable words and only ten three-syllable words, three of which are proper nouns he was stuck with. Notice how many of the governor’s words are anything but vague: leaves, wind, frost, air, evening, earth, comforts, soil, labor, breath, body, justice, courage, peace, land, rites, home. They are homely words in the best sense—they catch the rhythm of the seasons and the dailiness of life. Also notice that all of them are nouns. After verbs, plain nouns are your strongest tools; they resonate with emotion.</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001378\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001378\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>But ultimately eloquence runs on a deeper current. It moves us with what it leaves unsaid, touching off echoes in what we already know from our reading, our religion and our heritage. Eloquence invites us to bring some part of ourselves to the transaction. It was no accident that Lincoln’s speeches resounded with echoes of the King James Bible; he knew it almost by heart from his boyhood, and he had so soaked himself in its sonorities that his formal English was more Elizabethan than American. The Second Inaugural Address reverberates with Biblical phrases and paraphrases: “It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God’s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men’s faces, but let us judge not, that we be not judged.” The first half of the sentence borrows a metaphor from Genesis, the second half reshapes a famous command in Matthew, and “a just God” is from Isaiah.</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001379\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001379\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>If this speech affects me more than any other American document, it’s not only because I know that Lincoln was killed five weeks later, or because I’m moved by all the pain that culminated in his plea for a reconciliation that would have malice toward none and charity for all. It’s also because Lincoln tapped some of Western man’s oldest teachings about slavery, clemency and judgment. His words carried stern overtones for the men and women who heard him in 1865, reared, as he was, on the Bible. But even in the 21st century it’s hard not to feel a wrath almost too ancient to grasp in Lincoln’s notion that God might will the Civil War to continue “until all the wealth piled by the bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said ‘the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.’”</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001380\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001380\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>Wilbur Cross’s Thanksgiving Proclamation also echoes with truths that we know in our bones.

Toni Morrison, one of the most eloquent of black writers, once said: “I remember the language of the people I grew up with. Language was so important to them. All that power was in it. And grace and metaphor. Some of it was very formal and Biblical, because the habit is that when you have something important to say you go into parable, if you’re from Africa, or you go into another level of language. I wanted to use language that way, because my feeling was that a black novel was not black because I wrote it, or because there were black people in it, or because it was about black things.

With fiction it’s a different situation. Because authors of fiction are writing about a world of their own invention, often in an allusive style that they have also invented (Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo), we have no right to tell them, “That’s wrong.” We can only say, “It doesn’t work for me.” Nonfiction writers get no such break. They are infinitely accountable: to the facts, to the people they interviewed, to the locale of their story and to the events that happened there. They are also accountable to their craft and all its perils of excess and disorder: losing the reader, confusing the reader, boring the reader, not keeping the reader engaged from beginning to end. With every inaccuracy of reporting and every misstep of craft we can say, “That’s wrong.”</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001396\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001396\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>How can you fight off all those fears of disapproval and failure? One way to generate confidence is to write about subjects that interest you and that you care about. The poet Allen Ginsberg, another writer who came to Yale to talk to my students, was asked if there was a moment when he consciously decided to become a poet. Ginsberg said, “It wasn’t quite a choice—it was a realization. I was twenty-eight and I had a job as a market researcher. One day I told my psychiatrist that what I really wanted to do was to quit my job and just write poetry. And the psychiatrist said, ‘Why not?’ And I said, ‘What would the American Psychoanalytical Association say?’ And he said, ‘There’s no party line.’ So I did.”</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001397\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001397\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>We’ll never know how big a loss that was for the field of market research. But it was a big moment for poetry. There’s no party line: good advice for writers. You can be your own party line. Red Smith, delivering the eulogy at the funeral of a fellow sports-writer, said, “Dying is no big deal. Living is the trick.” One of the reasons I admired Red Smith was that he wrote about sports for 55 years, with grace and humor, without succumbing to the pressure, which was the ruin of many sportswriters, that he ought to be writing about something “serious.” He found in sportswriting what he wanted to do and what he loved doing, and because it was right for him he said more important things about American values than many writers who wrote about serious subjects—so seriously that nobody could read them.</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001398\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001398\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>Living is the trick.

I asked him about his early teachers and mentors—major American artists like John Sloan and Edwin Dickinson—and about the influence of the great bird painters James Audubon and Louis Agassiz Fuertes, and my story became an art story and a teaching story as well as a bird story, engaging many of my interests.

The good news, which he had lived long enough to see, was that many species had made a comeback from their narrow escape, helped by a citizenry that now takes an active role in protecting birds and their habitats.

The second Land Rover took our other two tour members and two boys who were described as “apprentices.” Nobody said what they were apprenticing for.</span></p></div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001553\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001553\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><div class=\\\"quote\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001554\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001554\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"bodytext\\\"><span>Another startling fact that needs no embellishment—the tire-pumping—and another small joke at the end.</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001555\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001555\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><div class=\\\"quote\\\">\\n</div></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001556\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001556\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><div class=\\\"quote\\\"><p class=\\\"extract\\\"><span>We drove straight out into the Sahara.

First I went to Shanghai with the musicians Willie Ruff and Dwike Mitchell when they introduced jazz to China at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. A year later I went to Venice with Ruff to hear him play Gregorian chants on his French horn in St. Mark’s basilica at night, when nobody else was there, to study the acoustics that inspired the Venetian school of music. In both cases Ruff had no assurance that he would be allowed to play; I might have wasted my time and money by deciding to go along. But I got on the plane, and those two long pieces, which originally ran in <i class=\\\"calibre9\\\">The New Yorker</i>, are probably my two best articles. I got on the plane to Timbuktu to look for a camel caravan that was an even bet not to materialize, and I got on the plane to Bradenton for spring training not knowing whether I would be welcomed or rebuffed. My book <i class=\\\"calibre9\\\">Writing to Learn</i> was born because of one phone call from a stranger.

Twice I threw out an entire chapter of a book because editors told me it was unnecessary. But above all I remember those good editors for their generosity.

A bad editor has a compulsion to tinker, proving with busywork that he hasn’t forgotten the minutiae of grammar and usage.

Very often it simply doesn’t occur to him that a writer is writing by ear, trying to achieve a particular sound or cadence, or playing with words just for the pleasures of wordplay.

A minor one that comes to mind involved an article I wrote about a program called Visiting Artists, which brought artists and musicians to a group of economically depressed Midwestern cities. Describing them, I wrote: “They don’t look like cities that get visited by many visiting artists.” When the galleys came back the sentence said: “They don’t look like cities that are on the itinerary of many visiting artists.” A small point? Not to me. I had used repetition because it’s a device I like—it takes readers by surprise and refreshes them in midsentence. But the editor remembered the rule about substituting synonyms for words that are repeated, and he corrected my error. When I called to protest, he was amazed. We argued for a long time, neither of us yielding. Finally he said, “You really feel strongly about this, don’t you?” I feel strongly that one such erosion leads to another and that the writer must take a stand. I’ve even bought articles back from magazines that made changes I wouldn’t accept. If you allow your distinctiveness to be edited out, you will lose one of your main virtues.

Frequently an editor will make a change to clarify a muddy sentence and will inadvertently lose an important point—a fact or a nuance that the writer included for reasons the editor didn’t know about. In such cases the writer should ask to have his point back. The editor, if he agrees, should oblige. But he should also insist on his right to fix whatever had been unclear. Clarity is what every editor owes the reader. An editor should never allow something to get into print that he doesn’t understand. If <i class=\\\"calibre9\\\">he</i> doesn’t understand it, at least one other person won’t, and that’s one too many.

One unpleasant change in the publishing profession has been the erosion of courtesies that were once routine. Magazine editors, especially, have become cavalier about a whole series of procedures that should be automatic: notifying the writer that the piece has arrived, reading it with reasonable speed, telling the writer whether it’s O.K., returning it immediately if it’s not, working supportively with the writer if the piece needs changes, sending the writer galley proofs, seeing that the writer gets paid promptly.

He covered vast distances in the outfield, moving in graceful strides, always arriving ahead of the ball, making the hardest catch look routine, and even when he was at bat, hitting the ball with tremendous power, he didn’t appear to be exerting himself. I marveled at how effortless he looked because what he did could only be achieved by great daily effort. A reporter once asked him how he managed to play so well so consistently, and he said: “I always thought that there was at least one person in the stands who had never seen me play, and I didn’t want to let him down.”</span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001679\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001679\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><h2 class=\\\"h2b\\\"><span class=\\\"calibre1\\\"><$link class=\\\"calibre8\\\" to=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000000043\\\">SOURCES</$link></span></h2></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001680\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001680\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"image1\\\"><span><$image alt=\\\"Image\\\" class=\\\"calibre3\\\" source=\\\"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/images/images/00001.jpeg\\\"></$image></span></p></div>\"\n        },\n        \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001681\": {\n            \"role\": \"text\",\n            \"title\": \"$:/plugins/twpub/153846e997d940b6/text/000001681\",\n            \"type\": \"text/vnd.twpub\",\n            \"text\": \"<div class=\\\"twpub-153846e997d940b6-f15030 twpub-153846e997d940b6-9882b5\\\"><p class=\\\"toca\\\"><span>The pagination of this electronic edition does not match the edition from which it was created.
